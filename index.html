          <h2>CONTEMPLATING...</h2>
          <p>My favourite colour is Green. My reasons for liking Green is because it represents life, spring, and nature. It also encourages fresh, tranquil feelings. But recently, the colour <span>Yellow</span> is catching my eye. I am using this assignment to take the opportunity to study this colour, and find out if my like for it exceeds my like for the colour Green. The next paragraph will tell about my decision. 
          <p>I noticed that the colour <span>Yellow</span> carries light and happy emotions in many aspects. Like the golden sun young kids like to draw, the sunflowers that follow the sun, the friendship a <span>Yellow</span> flower represents, and the mood a <span>Yellow</span> room encourages. Light, like the light God's word brings into our lives. My respect for this colour has increased during my research. However, Green is still my favourite. I think <span>Yellow</span> can settle for 2<sup>nd</sup>. :)

          <h2>THINGS I FOUND OUT:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Beautifully decorated <span>Yellow</span> rooms are bright and lifts emotions. 
            <li><span>Yellow</span> roses are a symbol of friendship. Happy and fun. 
            <li>Light is commonly associated with <span>Yellow</span>. Light gives way to the truth because it lets you see.
            <li>When young children draw the sun, they reach for the <span>Yellow</span> colour to draw it. 
            <li>The lego people who are amusing both to watch and to play with are <span>Yellow</span> skinned.
